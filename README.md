## What is DOOM? ##

(from http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom)

"Doom (officially cased DOOM) is the first release of the Doom series, and one
of the games that consolidated the first-person shooter genre. With a science
fiction and horror style, it gives the players the role of marines who find
themselves in the focal point of an invasion from hell. The game introduced
deathmatch and cooperative play in the explicit sense, and helped further the
practice of allowing and encouraging fan-made modifications of commercial
video games."
